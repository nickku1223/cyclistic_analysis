# Project Overview
This project is the capstone project for Google Professional Certificate for Data Analytics. Cyclistic is a fictional bike-sharing based in Chicago, the director of marketing believes the future success depoonds on maximizing the number of annual members, and would like to find out how annual members and casual riders use the services differently.

In this project I'm trying to dicover insights, relationships and create visualizations for the results, and to make summary and suggestions based on the results of the analysis.

# Results  
### Annual Members vs Casual Riders

From this result we can see that annual members have about 1/3 more usage than casual users.  

### Average Trip Duration

Annual members mostly use the service for commuting, they have average 12 mins of trip duration. Whereas casual riders use the service more for leisure, so they have longer trip duration, about 24 mins.
